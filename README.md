# React Ts Todo list with slide drop

### *Little projet i did few months ago to practice TypeScript on a React project The most interesting part was to investigate the slide and drop part. I did not use any libraries for it*


- Add a todo
- Delete a todo
- Todos are saved on page refresh (local storage)
- Reorder todos by using mouse slide and drop
